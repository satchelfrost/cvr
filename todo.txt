* get basic hello world (android logging) android example running
    - create a platform_quest.c
    - add the dependencies for the compiler / tools to build for android
    - create android_main.c for 3d-primitives
* need to create an openxr header only file
* need to pull out (or at least toggle) glfw dependency from vk_ctx.h
* need ctx inside of vk_ctx.h to be renamed to vk_ctx, because
  we will have an xr_ctx whose name shouldn't conflict.
